# interview-task

## Scope

In this test you are required to read all json files which exist in the main resources folder and spot and count all important words that do exist.
Top would be to have a final api which return the top 10 words found and send each word final count to a kafka topic.

We have put few files in the resources but you should think like you have thousands of them and we should not wait too much for the results.


We want to test

- ability of understanding the requirement or get additional info
- ability of reading files from jar ( jar should run in a docker )
- ability of using Spring Boot 2.0 or greater
- ability of unit testing
- ability of functional testing
- ability of creating REST API
- ability of sending data to Kafka
- ability to use multithreading
